## Abstract

Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful framework for performing Bayesian inference when likelihood functions are intractable. However, there remains a significant gap between methodological advances and practical deployment. In this talk, I discuss:

1. **Current State of SBI Methods**: Overview of neural posterior/likelihood/ratio estimation approaches
2. **The Applicability Gap**: Why aren't more practitioners using SBI?
3. **Software Solutions**: How the sbi package addresses usability challenges
4. **Real-world Case Studies**: Applications in neuroscience, epidemiology, and climate science
5. **Future Directions**: Scaling SBI to higher dimensions and real-time applications

## Key Takeaways

- SBI methods are mature enough for practical deployment
- Software accessibility is crucial for adoption
- Domain-specific customization often required
- Diagnostics and validation remain challenging

## Venue

**TransferLab Internal Seminar Series**  
appliedAI Institute for Europe  
Munich, Germany
