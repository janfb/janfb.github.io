##### Talk Summary

Simulators are essential in scientific research, yet parameter inference can be challenging for stochastic or black-box simulators. In this talk, I introduce simulation-based inference (SBI), a Bayesian method that uses simulated data for parameter estimation. I will also present the open-source `sbi` library, a central resource providing state-of-the-art SBI algorithms, comprehensive tutorials, and tools for accuracy checks and plotting. This talk highlights how SBI addresses challenges in parameter estimation for complex simulators across various fields like neuroscience and astrophysics.
