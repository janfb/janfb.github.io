##### Abstract

Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian inference for complex models without requiring analytical likelihood functions. The sbi Python package has become a key tool for SBI, but the field has evolved significantly since its initial release. This paper presents sbi reloaded, a comprehensive update introducing: (1) new inference algorithms including flow matching posterior estimation, (2) improved diagnostics and validation tools, (3) enhanced performance through architectural improvements, and (4) a more flexible API supporting custom neural network architectures. We demonstrate these improvements on benchmarks spanning neuroscience, epidemiology, and astrophysics, showing substantial gains in accuracy and computational efficiency. The package continues to provide a unified interface for SBI methods while maintaining backward compatibility and extensive documentation.
