## Tutorial Overview

**When:** August 19, 2025, 15:30â€“17:00  
**Where:** EuroSciPy 2025, Room 1.38 (Ground Floor)  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Level:** Intermediate  
**Materials:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/janfb/euroscipy-2025-sbi-tutorial)

## Description

Do you spend time tuning parameters for complex scientific simulators? Perhaps you use grid search or optimization to match parameters to data. These find a best-fit set, but often don't reveal your confidence or if other parameters also fit. This uncertainty is crucial for reliable conclusions.

This tutorial introduces **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)**, a modern technique tackling this challenge. Unlike traditional Bayesian inference methods (like MCMC) that require mathematical likelihood functions, SBI works directly with your simulator's outputs. Using recent advances in probabilistic ML, it estimates the probability distribution of parameter values consistent with your observations, even for complex "black-box" simulators. It provides not just a single best guess, but full parameter distributions representing parameter uncertainties and potential interactions.

## What You'll Learn

In this hands-on tutorial using the **sbi Python package**, you'll learn the practical steps:

1. **Setting up the problem** - Defining parameter ranges and checking model plausibility
2. **Running SBI for parameter distributions** - Applying different SBI techniques
3. **Checking result reliability** - Validating your inference results
4. **Interpreting results** - Drawing scientific conclusions from SBI outputs

We cover different SBI techniques and how to apply them to real-world problems.

## Tutorial Content

### The SBI Workflow

The tutorial provides a comprehensive, practical introduction to SBI using the sbi Python package. We guide you through the entire practical workflow:

- **A-priori checks**: Defining parameter ranges of interest and running initial simulations to check if the model can plausibly generate data similar to observations
- **Choosing and applying SBI methods**: Learning about different SBI strategies (like those that directly estimate parameter probabilities, approximate likelihoods, or work with probability ratios) and selecting one suitable for your specific problem
- **A-posteriori checks**: Evaluating how accurately the underlying machine learning models have learned to infer parameters
- **Interpretation**: Understanding and drawing scientific conclusions from SBI results

### Why SBI?

Traditional methods like grid search or numerical optimization algorithms can find a single 'best' set of parameters. However, they often struggle when there are many parameters, and more importantly, they usually don't quantify the uncertainty associated with the result. 

SBI methods learn a statistical relationship directly from running your simulator multiple times with different inputs. Their key advantage is the ability to estimate the range of parameter values (and their probabilities) that are consistent with your observed data, providing a measure of uncertainty. This works even for complex 'black-box' simulators where the internal equations might be unknown or intractable.
